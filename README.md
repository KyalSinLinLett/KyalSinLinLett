### Hi there, welcome to my github page 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently working with Elixir and Phoenix Framework(*as of Apr,2021*)

### My main focus areas
- Full stack development
- Deep learning (*w/ pytorch mostly*)
- Computer Vision (*Still learning*)
- Quick maffs (*Discrete structures, Calculus*)
- Network engineering (*I'll set up your home wifi for free, jk*)
